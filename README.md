# A-Z_Designers

![am_i_responsive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221374432-c301bff7-83df-4fa4-b443-0bf106b2dd4e.png)


### [A-Z_Designers](https://a-z-designers.herokuapp.com/) is my final milestone project at Code Institute and it is a full stack E-Commerce website developed to be a website for an online clothing store. This website allows users to purchase clothing that is in stock as Anonymous users and even create an account which allows them to save shipping/billing details and previous orders. This project demonstrates my learning and understanding throughout the course of full stack website development.

I believe I produced a website that is very adaptable and can be repurposed for many ecommerce applications, this includes subscriptions and transactional services. There are numerous features which I would like to have added for submission of this project, however, due to limited time this was not possible for the moment. Live project can be found [HERE](https://a-z-designers.herokuapp.com/)

**All documentation images can be found in the documentation folder**

## Test website functionality with these accounts
**If you wish to test account functionality, demo accounts have been provided below. Please note that not all error pages have been created and therefore on the occasional error the base django template will show up.**
| Username | Password | Desription |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| hodedar | 11@@11@@ | Customer account created with temp-mail and consists of multiple orders and reviews. (testing email confirmation was successful) |
| AZ_Designer_super | @@11@@11 | Admin account with create and update permissions to all custom models, these are accessible in the access admin area and product management on the website account section. |

##Products and accounts with testing done to them
- I have added some products to the **wishlist** on both accounts
- A purchase has been made on both accounts that shows up in the **my profile** section
- **Reviews** have been left in the NEW ARRIVALS category, on the gold womens watch, black belt and women's dress.

## Future Goals of A-Z_Designers
A-Z_Designers' plan is to expand rapidly by adding more and more new products for sale every week.
We plan to also increase the choice of sizes, variety of products and even colours.
Add filtering by rating

## Functionality goals
**Website functionality goals we strive to achieve over the next few website launches include** :
- Tracking of deliveries for users
- Set up an efficient way for users to submit a refund request without the need to contact customer support via email or phone call.
- Allow first time buyers a discount code to be used.
- Introduce coupons for various releases to promote users to use our services and be rewarded with a discount.

##  **Purpose**
  - The purpose of this E-Commerce website is to connect users with a retail business in which the user can purchase designer clothing online efficiently from the comfort of their home.
  - A-Z_Designers is a fully online based business that targets audience of ages between 18-50 both male and female and sells designer brand clothing through this ecommerce webiste. A customer does not have to go into a shop to make a purchase. We sell brands that are recognised by all and some brands that may not have been heard of by many.
  
## Business model
  - A-Z_Designers is a Business to Consumer (B2C) direct sellers of multiple brands of clothing products.

## Design & Branding
  - My website layout was inspired by Balenciaga, mainly their search bar spanning across the full width and the logo being in the middle.
  - Designs were done using Photoshop and Figma as a base template layout (Images are in the **documentation/figma_template_designs** folder)
  - The colour palette I went with is a very classy and simplistic white,brown,black blend ![colour_palette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221379868-d84418f9-85fa-4290-98aa-1d990e46dc0e.png)
  - My choice of font is a very classy yet not overly extravagant 'PT Serif' ![font_choice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221405870-6175dbc9-04a6-4268-8789-97b90c25b5ec.png)
  - All Branding images are in the **documentation/branding** folder


## Agile Methodology
  - Use of Github Issues and User Stories is involved as part of Agile methodology
  - Setting a label on issues allowed me to better understand which issues need focusing on first 
  - Which MUST be implemented 
  - Which can be left till last
  - When an issue is completed it gets moved from the in progress table to the completed table 
  - Completed issues also get marked as 'closed'
  
### Github Projects
GitHub Projects was used to manage the development of the site. It allowed me to break down large issues into smaller issues and focus on these while building it up to the completed project. I also used labels to distinguish the issues which are part of the setup, of the documentation, the must haves and which are not as important.

 ## Database ERD (Entity relationship diagram)
This ER diagram captures the relationships between real-world entities. The entities are the data points of objects such as persons, places and things and together with their attributes, compose their domain, ie, their individual table.

## Data Modelling
Each of the models below are used for the project and contain the fields and behaviours of the data being created and stored.

### User Model
  - The User model is a component of Django's Authentication system and contains information about the user.
  - The User model contains the following fields: username, email, first_name, last_name, password, is_staff, is_active, is_superuser, date_joined, and last_login.
 
### User Profile Model (Custom)
  - The UserProfile model is an extension of the Django User model and has a one-to-one relationship with it.
  - The UserProfile model contains the following fields that I customised to fit the requirements of my websites needs: user, default_address, default_city, default_county, default_postcode and default_country.
  - I did not wish to record their phone number as some may not be comfortable sharing this and our business does not intend to contact users directly over the phone
  
### Category Model (Customized)
  - To my category model I set it up in a way to categorise products first of all by Gender, then name and friendly_name which is displayed to users.
  
### Product Model (Customized)
  - The Product model contains the following fields: category, name, description, keywords, sku, colour, has_sizes, materials, , price and image.
  - Sku is a unique code identifier that i have limited to 8 characters and shows gender, abbreviates the product, colour and then takes a number i.e mnstrbl2 (men's trousers black 2)
  - The main purpose of the keywords is to add to search engine for the search bar, this opens up more choices for a user to enter a search criteria and find what they are looking for. Description is also scanned for these words and the name field. 
  - Has_sizes is a boolean field which checks products that do have a size selection and will in turn display the size selection option in product_detail.
  
### Order Model (customised)
  - The Order model contains the following fields: order_number, user_profile, full_name, email, country, postcode, city, address, date, delivery_cost, product_total, grand_total, original_bag and stripe_pid.
  - It contains UserProfile as a ForeignKey.
 
### OrderLineItem Model (customized)
  - The OrderLineItem model contains the following fields: order, product, product_size, quantity and lineitem_total.
  - It contains Order and Product as ForeignKeys.
 
### Review Model (Custom)
  - The Review model contains the following fields: product, user, rating, review and date.
  - It contains Product and User as ForeignKeys
  - Rating has a choice of RATING_CHOICES variable ranging from 1 to 5 for users to select.
  - Review field is a text field where any comments can be made about the product. 
  - The review form only requires a review and rating, and sets the username and date automatically.

### Wishlist Model (Custom)
  - The Wishlist model contains the following fields: user_profile, product and date_added.
  - It contains user_profile and product as ForeignKeys.

#### Started but limited time did not allow me to complete another model I wanted to implement
  - This is the **Discount** model
  - The purpose I see for this will be to generate new users a discount code ONLY for their FIRST purchase with us.
  - User would need to be fully registered
  - I have model created and the admin panel layout done but to implement it into the view and do all necessary testing will have taken me over the deadline
  - This model was not a priority for the goals of this website's launch.

## Defensive Programming
  -To keep the site secure and protected against an attack or attempts to access pages reserved solely based on user permission levels, defensive programming was at the forefront of the development.

  - I targetted login_required functionality across relevant views and templates.
  -On specific views.py files, I made sure to check if the user is authenticated.

## Payments
  - Stripe is used to handle payments on this website
  - The set up involved getting stripe public and secret keys and adding those to heroku config vars
  - Testing was done to confirm payments intents go through and the charge is succeeded.
  - Webhook handling in the checkout app takes care of issues like refreshing the page before successful payment to avoid errors or exploiting bugs.
  
  
## Testing 
  - For the testing process I used print statements and kept running the code after a new function was added which was noticeable when run
  - With new functionalities added I would straight away test them
  - Verified the HTML using the W3C HTML validator and all tests passed : https://validator.w3.org/
  - Verified CSS using the Jigsaw w3 css validator to confirm all css is valid : https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
  - Tested the python code by running it through PEP8 online :  http://pep8online.com/
  - I cleared up as many Python minor errors as possible
  - The only remaining errors were to indicate that the line is too long
  - JsHint was used to check JavaScript code : https://jshint.com/

### Manual Testing
  - I manually tested that **errors in the form fields** show up and required fields cannot be left empty.
  - Tested that messages get displayed when Logging in, adding to the bag, making any adjustments to products, on successfull or failed checkout, leaving a review,   editing a review, adding products to a wishlist and signing out.
  - Toasts successfully showed up in all occassions

#### Message Testing / Toasts

## Deployment 
  ### Heroku 
  - I deployed the project to heroku which is a cloud based hosting platform https://www.heroku.com/
    - Log in to Heroku
    - Select `New` and create a new app
    - Create an app name (as similar to repo name as possible)
    - Select a Region (Europe for me)
    - Click on `Create app`
  - Heroku took care of the config variables such as : DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY and CLOUDINARY_URL

  ### Elephant SQL
  - The database is deployed using ElephantSQL : https://www.elephantsql.com/
    - The region I selected allows for cloud storage with amazon AWS
    - Then I proceeded to set up an ElephantSQL database
    - This is done by creating a new instance on ElephantSQL 
    - Naming It
    - Select Table quries in BROWSER and select an option that looks familiar
    - The DATABASE URL is then pasted into heroku config vars 

  ### Github & Gitpod

  - The code institute full template is used for setting up this project on gitpod
  - When making a new repository
    -  Click `No Template` button
    -  Select the desired template
    -  Add a repository name
    -   To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`
    -   This will then start to build a workspace
  - The code is deployed and pushed to a Github branch which is then linked to heroku and set to automatically deploy with every push

  ### Amazon AWS Storage
 - To setup Amazon AWS I first of all searched IAM Management Console on amazon aws
 - ![amazon_aws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221433828-eaf1f9e4-3e03-41c8-b3f0-b71ae7a43864.png)
 - Using this panel I then created a **User Group**
 - Secondly created a *User* and linked it to the above **User Group*
 - And finally created a Policy which was linked to this *User*
 - Then I searched up "S3" which is scalable storage in the cloud
 - Created a bucket into which I added my media and static files by linking my project to Heroku


## Existing Bugs and Issues
  - When a product is added to the bag, if it is then deleted from the website this causes a server error 500
  - When saving information in the checkout form, it does not save it to the profile from there, however it does show up in the checkout form if filled out in the user profile. 
  - Filled out in Profile
  ![delivery_info_profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221434975-099b74ce-270b-45bc-b2c3-0530ba3e5934.png)

  - Changed in checkout form
![delivery_info_checkout_change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221434993-398aad5b-bad1-4f6e-a4ff-85444c6ee8ba.png)
  - No change appears
![no_change_in_delivery_info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221434999-2bd961df-43e0-443c-9dea-ebdd3c5a1f63.png)
  
  - Horizontal scroll bar appears on the wishlist page, I attempted to set overflow and width rules but was unable to fix this thus far.
  - In the bag page if the bag is empty, the footer is just below the div and does not stay at the bottom of the page. I attempted to set a height to the body and to the div containing the empty bag text but this didn't work or made the layout much worse when a product was then added to the bag. 
  - I will continue to work on these issues for the next release but the scheduled release of the website for the 27th of February did not allow enough time.
