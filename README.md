# A-Z_Designers

![am_i_responsive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221374432-c301bff7-83df-4fa4-b443-0bf106b2dd4e.png)


### [A-Z_Designers](https://a-z-designers.herokuapp.com/) is my final milestone project at Code Institute and it is a full stack E-Commerce website developed to be a website for an online clothing store. This website allows users to purchase clothing that is in stock as Anonymous users and even create an account which allows them to save shipping/billing details and previous orders. This project demonstrates my learning and understanding throughout the course of full stack website development.

### I believe I produced a website that is very adaptable and can be repurposed for many ecommerce applications, this includes subscriptions and transactional services. There are numerous features which I would like to have added for submission of this project, however, due to limited time this was not possible for the moment. Live project can be found [HERE](https://a-z-designers.herokuapp.com/)

If you wish to test account functionality, demo accounts have been provided below. Please note that not all error pages have been created and therefore on the occasional error the base django template will show up.

## Test website functionality with these accounts
| Username | Password | Desription |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| hodedar | 11@@11@@ | Customer account created with temp-mail and consists of multiple orders and reviews. (testing email confirmation was successful) |
| AZ_Designer_super | @@11@@11 | Admin account with create and update permissions to all custom models, these are accessible in the access admin area and product management on the website account section. |


## Products and accounts with testing done to them
- I have added some products to the wishlist on both accounts
- A purchase has been made on the admin account that shows up in my profile
- Reviews have been left in the NEW ARRIVALS category, on the gold womens watch, black belt and women's dress.

## Future Goals of A-Z_Designers
A-Z_Designers' plan is to expand rapidly by adding more and more new products for sale every week.
We plan to also increase the choice of sizes, variety of products and even colours.
Add filtering by rating

## Functionality goals
Website functionality goals we strive to achieve over the next few website launches include :
- Tracking of deliveries for users
- Set up an efficient way for users to submit a refund request without the need to contact customer support via email or phone call.
- Allow first time buyers a discount code to be used.
- Introduce coupons for various releases to promote users to use our services and be rewarded with a discount.

##  **Purpose**
  - The purpose of this E-Commerce website is to connect users with a retail business in which the user can purchase designer clothing online efficiently from the comfort of their home.
  - A-Z_Designers is a fully online based business that targets audience of ages between 18-50 both male and female and sells designer brand clothing through this ecommerce webiste. A customer does not have to go into a shop to make a purchase. We sell brands that are recognised by all and some brands that may not have been heard of by many.
  
## Business model
  - A-Z_Designers is a Business to Consumer (B2C) direct sellers of multiple brands of clothing products.

## Design & Branding
  - My website layout was inspired by Balenciaga, mainly their search bar spanning across the full width and the logo being in the middle.
  - Designs were done using Photoshop and Figma as a base template layout (Images are in the **documentation/figma_template_designs** folder)
  - The colour palette I went with is a very classy and simplistic white,brown,black blend ![colour_palette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221379868-d84418f9-85fa-4290-98aa-1d990e46dc0e.png)
  - My choice of font is a very classy yet not overly extravagant 'PT Serif' ![font_choice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97538312/221405870-6175dbc9-04a6-4268-8789-97b90c25b5ec.png)
  - All Branding images are in the **documentation/branding** folder


## Agile Methodology
  - Use of Github Issues and User Stories is involved as part of Agile methodology
  - Setting a label on issues allowed me to better understand which issues need focusing on first 
  - Which MUST be implemented 
  - Which can be left till last
  - When an issue is completed it gets moved from the in progress table to the completed table 
  - Completed issues also get marked as 'closed'

#### Accounts

This is where all customer information is retained via the **USER model**. I also made the decision to use Django-allauth which added the ability to override the username field, using the email address as the login. It also brought with it the ability to verify email addresses and reset passwords. Personalised email confirmation, and email verification templates are used. 
I created personalised Login, Sign Up, Sign out, forms with the help of crispy forms.
Crispy forms was installed using pip3 install django-crispy-forms and then add this to the apps section in settings.py
  
### Profiles
Users who create accounts can store their shipping and billing informtion for a faster shopping experience using the profiles custom model. This takes in some basic information from the user when the user is completing their checkout form.
This also allows the users to see their order history.

- For the testing process I used print statements and kept running the code after a new function was added which was noticeable when run
- Verified the HTML using the W3C HTML validator and all tests passed : https://validator.w3.org/
- Verified CSS using the Jigsaw w3 css validator to confirm all css is valid : https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- Tested the python code by running it through PEP8 online :  http://pep8online.com/
- JsHint was used to check JavaScript code : https://jshint.com/
- The only errors were to indicate that the line is too long
- I manually tested that errors in the form fields show up and required fields cannot be left empty
- Tested that messages get displayed when Logging in, adding to the bag, making any adjustments to products, on successfull or failed checkout and signing out.

## Deployment 
  ### Heroku 
  - I deployed the project to heroku which is a cloud based hosting platform https://www.heroku.com/
    - Log in to Heroku
    - Select `New` and create a new app
    - Create an app name (as similar to repo name as possible)
    - Select a Region (Europe for me)
    - Click on `Create app`
  - Heroku took care of the config variables such as : DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY and CLOUDINARY_URL

  ### Elephant SQL
  - The database is deployed using ElephantSQL : https://www.elephantsql.com/
    - This is done by creating a new instance on ElephantSQL 
    - Select Table quries in BROWSER and select an option that looks familiar
    - The DATABASE URL is then pasted into heroku config vars 

  ### Github & Gitpod

  - The code institute full template is used for setting up this project on gitpod
  - When making a new repository
    -  Click `No Template` button
    -  Select the desired template
    -  Add a repository name
    -   To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`
    -   This will then start to build a workspace
  - The code is deployed and pushed to a Github branch which is then linked to heroku and set to automatically deploy with every push
